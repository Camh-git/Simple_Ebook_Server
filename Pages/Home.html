              The library neatly displays all the books you have saved on the
              server, located in the /Books folder.

              Your books are shown in their folders to make them easier to find
              and can be be managed using the library and book options on the
              management page.

              You can read your books on the browser using our library page,

              Books that are in an unsupported file type will show up as
              yellow(WIP/beta support) or red (currently unsupported), you can
              still read them, but they will have to be downloaded first.
