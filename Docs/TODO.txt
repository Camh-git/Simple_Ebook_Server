This should really be a trello/zenhub board

Remaining:

  Major:
	Modify CSS to allow decent mobile use
	add password authentication to the required endpoints

  Minor:
	Implement Epub reader
	Implement a reader for simple txt files
	Add a start guide to the readme
	populate and use the thumbnail cache
	go through the js and add cammel case/ generaly tidy up
	set constant vars(not just const) where appropriate, apply screaming snake case
	move management php/js to other files, make the folder and book select js names more sensible
	re-implement the name tidying in the management dropdowns, have it change the source file name to maintain control(maybe clean on upload since it's also php)
	add user feedback when an API request goes through - and fetch the new books list so that the dropdowns remain synced
	see if it is possible to do without the extension paramaters on the api by using the basenames directly
	add security to fetch settings
	Investigate why the placement of the management page's "book_collection" div changes how the page populates
	add a option to clear endpoints to allow keeping of manualy uploaded files

Completed:
	Convert the library to 4 collumns instead of 3
	populate the management page's select elements using the library's contents
	add kebab case for CSS
	Populate management with basic crud commands
	setup api
	setup api calls from the management page 
	Populate management with basic crud commands
	Modify manage acls route to only take the actual values call_endpoints sends
	Modify endpoints to handle not having optional values provided
	add update dir and show ip lists options for call_and_display
	Maybe find a way to remove the stacking Populate_management_selects.js script tags on the management that happens when the selects are updated
