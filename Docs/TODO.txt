This should really be a trello/zenhub board

Remaining:

  Major:
    Populate management with basic crud commands
    Implement management scripts
	Modify CSS to allow decent mobile use
	
	setup calls

  Minor:
	Implement Epub reader
	Implement a reader for simple txt files
	Add a start guide to the readme
	populate and use the thumbnail cache
	go through the js and add cammel case
	set constant vars(not just const) where appropriate, apply screaming snake case
	move management php/js to other files, make the folder and book select js names more sensible
	re-implement the name tidying in the management dropdowns, have it change the source file name (maybe clean on upload since its also php) to maintain control
	add user feedback when an API request goes through
	implement password checks on the api fields that require them
	see if it is possible to do without the extension paramaters on the api by using the basenames directly

	
	

Completed:
	Convert the library to 4 collumns instead of 3
	populate the management page's select elements using the library's contents
	add kebab case for CSS
	setup api
