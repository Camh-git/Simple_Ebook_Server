This should really be a trello/zenhub board

Remaining:

  Major:
    Populate management with basic crud commands
	Modify CSS to allow decent mobile use
	add password authentication to the required endpoints

  Minor:
	Implement Epub reader
	Implement a reader for simple txt files
	Add a start guide to the readme
	populate and use the thumbnail cache
	go through the js and add cammel case/ generaly tidy up
	set constant vars(not just const) where appropriate, apply screaming snake case
	move management php/js to other files, make the folder and book select js names more sensible
	re-implement the name tidying in the management dropdowns, have it change the source file name to maintain control(maybe clean on upload since it's also php)
	add user feedback when an API request goes through - and fetch the new books list so that the dropdowns remain synced
	see if it is possible to do without the extension paramaters on the api by using the basenames directly
	Add a way to see the IP lists and their status on the management pannel
	Try and move the call functions directly into the event handlers, since they should all only be one line now
	
	

Completed:
	Convert the library to 4 collumns instead of 3
	populate the management page's select elements using the library's contents
	add kebab case for CSS
	Populate management with basic crud commands
	setup api
	setup api calls from the management page 
	Modify manage acls route to only take the actual values call_endpoints sends
	Modify endpoints to handle not having optional values provided
